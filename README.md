# :rocket: Starwars Movies

This is a simple web application using the SWAPI API

MVP:

- The app should be responsive and styled with a mobile first approach.
- Create a page to display movies with live data fetched from the Star Wars API.
- Create a navigation to switch between pages in the application.
- Use a Loader component when loading movie data.
- When a user clicks on a movie, a single movie page should display data from that movie.
- Create a page to list characters. This page should be empty to start with, and only get characters added as the user clicks into the different movies. This page should only list characters belonging to movies that the user has clicked on.
